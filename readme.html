<b>Welcome to the ConnectAll (tm) two tier docker installation.</b>

The first time you bring up the container run the setup script.

You can then stop and start the containers but please run the "stop" before shutting down and run the "start" script when starting up. This will start jp Mule and Tomcat.<br>

Once running you can access the ConnectAll user interface at <a href="http://localhost/ConnectAll">ConnectAll</a><br>

Enjoy, and submit any bug reports <a href="https://jira.connectall.com/servicedesk/customer/portal/11">here</s\a>.
